###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
*I learned about the differences and uses of padding, borders, and margin within this challenge. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within the box. Borders are what separates the edge of one box from another. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. Creating gaps between the borders of two adjacent boxes, or the edge of the page.
###What did you learn about CSS positioning?
*I learned about the four different positions, Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed. Static is the standard position elements are in when created and stack on one another. Relative positioning allows the position of elements to move without effecting other static elements. Absolute positioning moves the element from its DOM and moves it compared to its parent. Fixed positioning moves the element to a fixed position on the page, allowing the element to move with the browser.
###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
*At this point, while learning how to implement CSS into HTML there has not been much that was easy to implement, but changing the font size and color was probably the easiest. The most difficult by far has been working on positioning the elements on the page and how to display those elements.
###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
*I learned how to link a stylesheet, create classes and ids on HTML to make specific elements for CSS to select and change. Learned also how to identify other selectors and change the position, color, display, margin, padding, amongs others to manipulate elements.
