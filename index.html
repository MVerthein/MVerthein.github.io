          I am Michael Verthein and I am currently a student at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago IL. I have always had an interest in web development but never knew exactly where to start, so this is my development website to explore my knowledge and help inform others along the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past 5 years I had been working at Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana. While I did enjoy my time dealing and supervising in their table games department I felt like I needed a change. So I jumped head first into Dev Bootcamp to learn as much as I can!
        </p>
        <p>
          This website will be updated regularly, as new projects, blogs, and knowledge is obtained to improve my skillsets. Feel free to look around and contact me if you have any questions, advice, or just want to say hi.
