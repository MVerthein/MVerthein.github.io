        This is the first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, and so far it has been pretty overwhelming and amazing. I went into this program knowing next to nothing and so far learned a ton in the command crash course and with git.

          Diving staight into it, version control gives you control and access to all versions of your work. With version control, you can work on a single project and be able to jump around between a number of different versions of the same project. Then you can compare changes over time, and if others are working on the same project, you can also see who last modified the project and when they last modified it.

          Git uses branches to help track changes, when creating and making changes to files, you can make a new branch when making changes so you have multiple versions of the same file. Git then provides a history of the content changes made and can also favilitate collaborative changes to files.

          The best reason to use GitHub is the ease of use and the ability to easily share your repositories with others. Using git command-line interface makes it easy to make, edit, and store repostories onto GitHub.
