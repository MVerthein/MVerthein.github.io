        This week I will explain the best practices associated with using classes and ids. The main reason I want to explain the best practice and how to use these is because when I first reviewed this material, I was questioning the best practices too. While I was not hung up on the idea of what they do, but the best way to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both class and id are both CSS selectors that will target any element whose attribute has a value of note or introduction. Which is a complicated way of saying if you define a class in html, css will have a matching element to target rules. For example if I had a heading in html h1 id="top" then on css I will have the corresponding #top {}. Additionally if I had the paragraph p class="note" then on css I will have the corresponding .note{}.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now you know what the tag and selectors are, what is the best use for them. For best practice you want to use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout a page or your entire site. Ids you want to use when you create a unique element to your site. For example if you want your header on each page to look identical, you would use the class selector and use the same class on multiple elements.
