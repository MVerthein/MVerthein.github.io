      <h4>Arrays and Hashes!</h4>
      <p>This week has been all about arrays and hashes, and there are some similarites and more importantly differences between both of them. Most importantly both arrays and hashes are collections available to store and look up data given</p>
      <p>To start, the best way to think of arrays as a given list of items. Just a simple collection of data to me used in some sort of order. For exmaple if we just wanted a list of the months of the year, we would create an array for that data.</p>
        ```
        months = ["January", "February", "March"]
        ```
      <p>As for hashes, its best to think of hashes as a collection of pairs of information, and each pair includes the name and a value. The name is called a key and must be unique within the hash, and that key is paired with the value. A good example of a use of a hash would be a title of a movie, and it being paired with the rating of the movie.</p>
        ```
        movie_ratings = { "Jaws" => 97, "Inception" => 86, "Zoolander 2" => 19 }
        ```
      <p>In the example above each movie is paired with a movie rating, so when we want the rating we would call the movie_rating by the movie and would get a return of its rating. ex. movie_rating(Inception) we would get a return of 86</p>
