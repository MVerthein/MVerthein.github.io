    <h1>ALL ABOUT ME!!</h1>

    <section>
      <p>Hey there! So I grew up in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Lived most of my live in that area, when to college at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where I got my bachlours in criminal justice. Soon after graduating, I moved down to Chicago, Illinois to move in with my girlfriend (now fiancee) while she finished her masters at the University of Chicago.</p>
      <p>When I first moved down to Chicago, I got one of the first jobs I could to pay the bills, working as a dealer at Horseshoe Hammond Casino in Hammond, Indiana. I worked there for five years working in the Table Games department working my way up to a Dual-Rate Supervisor. After five years of working grave shift, losing sleep, working weekends and holidays, I decided to leave it all behind to focus on a passion of mine. Enter: Dev Bootcamp!</p>
      <p>Now, I never think of myself as a quirky person, or even a very interesting person. I have similar interests as any normal twenty-something year old guy. However, I do have an extreme love for Walt Disney World. Really, who doesnt love Walt Disney World? I did an intership in Walt Disney World in 2008, and have wanted to go back to visit every year since.</p>
