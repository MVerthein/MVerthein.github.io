          How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
            It was interesting creating a wireframe and HTML page with a pair, we had similar ideas of what we wanted the wireframe to look like, which was simple, clean and neat. Our skills are not professional yet, so we want to keep it simple.
          Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
            I did find it very helpful, It gives a nice visual aspect to the process, instead of just writing out code in hopes that it looks the way you want in your head.
          What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
            We decided something that is simple and clean look, a simple header, body, and footer to make each blog post neat.
          What new semantic elements did you learn about(if any)?
            Nothing new at the moment, but we plan to keep learning new semantics in the future.
